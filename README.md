Aspiring junior developer with a keen interest in technology and web development. I am currently a full-time student in the \_nology Tech Consultancy programme, where I am learning new concepts in a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

My portfolio aims to engage my audience through a combination of clear, defined design, subtle effects, and project-specific purpose.

Interested in front-end development, my end-goal is to utilise my educational background, experience and new software development skills to apply to real-life applications and websites within a collaborative environment.

## Tech Stack Used

-   HTML
-   CSS/ SCSS
